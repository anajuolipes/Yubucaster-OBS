Write your sentences in Editor.txt and keep everything in the same folder; Run Yubucaster.exe for it to start changing the sentences.
After the list ran out of lines, the script will die and keep the last phrase shown.

i plan to change the cooldown between the phrases in a easier way too.
Thanks you so much for using Yubucaster.
